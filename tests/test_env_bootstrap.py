"""The .env template: where it lives, and the copy written on first run.

Two things are pinned here. ``.env.example`` in the repo root must match
``ENV_TEMPLATE`` in config, because they are two faces of one thing -- the file
a reader opens has to be the file a fresh install actually receives, or the
instructions drift away from the behaviour. And ``ensure_env_file`` must create
that file when none exists while never touching one that does: it runs on every
CLI start, so a mistake there would overwrite real credentials.

Style note for future edits
---------------------------
The bootstrap runs in a subprocess with WATCHMAKER_HOME pointed at tmp_path,
because config resolves ENV_FILE at import time. Calling it in-process would
resolve against the checkout and write a .env into the repo instead.
Comparisons normalise line endings: git may check the example out with CRLF
while ENV_TEMPLATE is a Python string with LF, and that gap is not a defect.
