"""The project-home override that makes an installed copy usable.

Every path this program touches -- .env, and the directories it writes --
hangs off one root. Unset, that root is the repo checkout, which is how it has
always behaved and how the README tells people to run it. ``WATCHMAKER_HOME`` points
it somewhere else, which is the only reason an installed copy is usable at
all: inside a venv the config module lives in site-packages, and telling a
user to edit a .env in there is not a real instruction.

Both halves matter enough to pin. If the override breaks, installing the
package silently goes back to writing into site-packages. If the *default*
breaks, every existing user's data appears to vanish, because the program
starts looking for it somewhere new.

Style note for future edits
---------------------------
config resolves its paths at import time, so these spawn a real subprocess
with a real environment. Reloading the module in-process would not re-run that
resolution the way a user's shell does, and would prove nothing. To cover a
new path, add its attribute name to ``PATH_ATTRS`` -- the subprocess prints
whatever it is asked for, so no other change is needed.
